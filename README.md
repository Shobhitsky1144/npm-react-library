in this repo code, we will convert react app to library and publish it on npm. 

1.We will add a folder library in root folder.

2.Whose package will create package.json file and give information about our library like library name, author name, third party  Library name.

 3.People can access this library by this library name only.  
 
4.Here is a card component in which we can pass text and color through props and can access this library in any project.
